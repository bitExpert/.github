# We are bitExpert

We know and live the project business. We support our customers with individual project consulting and trend-setting developments as well as IT-Support for the projects and products we develop. The basic principle for our solutions, products and services is innovation, quality, commitment and professionalism.

## We support Open-Source

Besides using Open-Source solutions for our daily business, we contribute to Open-Source projects and maintain our own set of Open-Source tools. Our employees can use their Learn&Grow time budget to contribute to any Open-Source project they like.

## We support Community

We actively support the software development community. We help organize meetups like the [PHP UG Frankfurt Meetup](https://www.phpugffm.de) or the [PHP UG Metrolpolregion Rhein-Neckar Meetup](http://www.phpugmrn.de). We also like to provide our office space for local meetup gatherings and had a lot of fun hosting the [PHPUnit Code Sprint](https://phpunit.de/code-sprints/september-2019.html) back in 2019. If we can help, contact us!

Once a year we organize [unKonf](https://www.unKonf.de) an unconference focussing on web development & software development topics. We usually have about 120 nerds in our office for an awesome day of learning.

Also, we love to share our thoughts and experiences in our [blog](https://blog.bitExpert.de). These are our latest blog posts:
